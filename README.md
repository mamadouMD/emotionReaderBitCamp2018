# emotionReaderBitCamp2018

This is a project by Mamadou Mouctar, and Shawn Jassal during the 2018 Bit Camp event at the University of Maryland College Park.

This project will learn about the relationships between twitter users. The program will take in a twitter handle. Then it will parse all the tweets and form relationships between the users emotion and those the user talks about in their tweets. We will run their tweets against multiple Emotional/Sentiment Analysis API's. With this we predicate a user's behavior towards a person.

API's We Use:
uClassify
