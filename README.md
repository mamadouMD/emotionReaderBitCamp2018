# emotionReaderBitCamp2018

This is a project by Mamadou Mouctar, and Shawn Jassal during the 2018 Bit Camp event at the University of Maryland College Park.

This project will learn about the relationships between twitter users. The program will take in a twitter handle, and parse all the tweets of that twitter handle. From this we will analyze the connections between the current handle and all other connections referred to in the tweets. We use the free version of Indico, a sentiment analysis program.
